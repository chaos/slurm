# Purpose: Test of SLURM functionality
#          Test of srun signal forwarding
#
# Output:  "TEST: #.#" followed by "SUCCESS" if test was successful, OR
#          "FAILURE: ..." otherwise with an explanation of the failure, OR
#          anything else indicates a failure mode that must be investigated.
#
# Note:    This script generates and then deletes files in the working directory
#          named test1.32.prog
