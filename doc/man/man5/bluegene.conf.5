.SH "NAME"
bluegene.conf \- SLURM configuration file for BlueGene systems

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBbluegene.conf\fP is an ASCII file which describes IBM BlueGene specific
SLURM configuration information. This includes specifications for bgblock
layout, configuration, logging, etc.
The file location can be modified at system build time using the
DEFAULT_SLURM_CONF parameter or at execution time by setting the SLURM_CONF
environment variable. The file will always be located in the
same directory as the \fBslurm.conf\fP file.
.LP
Parameter names are case insensitive.
Any text following a "#" in the configuration file is treated
as a comment through the end of that line.
The size of each line in the file is limited to 1024 characters.
Changes to the configuration file take only effect upon restart of
the slurmctld daemon.  "scontrol reconfigure" does nothing with this file.
Changes will only take place after a restart of the controller.
.LP
There are some differences between BlueGene/L, BlueGene/P and  BlueGene/Q
systems with respects to the contents of the bluegene.conf file.

.SH "The BlueGene/L specific options are:"
.TP
\fBAltBlrtsImage\fR
Alternative BlrtsImage.  This is an optional field only used for multiple
images on a system and should be followed by a Groups option indicating
the user groups allowed to use this image (i.e. Groups=da,jette). If
Groups is not specified then this image will be usable by all
groups. You can put as many alternative images as you want in the
bluegene.conf file.

.TP
\fBAltLinuxImage\fR
Alternative LinuxImage.  This is an optional field only used for multiple
images on a system and should be followed by a Groups option indicating

Groups is not specified then this image will be usable by all
groups. You can put as many alternative images as you want in the
bluegene.conf file.

.TP
\fBAltRamDiskImage\fR
Alternative RamDiskImage.  This is an optional field only used for multiple
images on a system and should be followed by a Groups option indicating

.TP
\fBCnloadImage\fR
CnloadImage used for creation of all bgblocks.

.TP

.SH "All options below are common on all BlueGene systems:"
.TP
\fBAltMloaderImage\fR
Alternative MloaderImage.  This is an optional field only used for multiple
images on a system and should be followed by a Groups option indicating
the user groups allowed to use this image (i.e. Groups=da,jette). If
Groups is not specified then this image will be usable by all
groups. You can put as many alternative images as you want in the conf file.

.TP
\fBBasePartitionNodeCount\fR
The number of c\-nodes (compute nodes) per base partition.
There is no default value and this must be specified (usually 512).

.TP
\fBBridgeAPILogFile\fR
Fully qualified pathname of a into which the Bridge API logs are
to be written.
There is no default value.

.TP
\fBBridgeAPIVerbose\fR
Specify how verbose the Bridge API logs should be.
The default value is 0.
.RS
.TP
\fB0\fR: Log only error and warning messages
.TP
\fB1\fR: Log level 0 plus information messages
.TP
\fB2\fR: Log level 1 plus basic debug messages
.TP
\fB3\fR: Log level 2 plus more debug message
.TP
\fB4\fR: Log all messages
.RE

.TP
\fBDenyPassthrough\fR
Specify which dimensions you do not want to allow pass\-throughs.
Valid options are A, X, Y, Z or all ("A" applies only to BlueGene/Q systems).
For example, to prevent pass\-throughs in the X and Y dimensions you would
specify "DenyPassthrough=X,Y".
By default, pass\-throughs are enabled in every dimension.

.TP
\fBLayoutMode\fR
Describes how SLURM should create bgblocks.
.RS
.TP 10
\fBSTATIC\fR:
Create and use the defined non\-overlapping bgblocks.
.TP
\fBOVERLAP\fR:
Create and use the defined bgblocks, which may overlap.
It is highly recommended that none of the bgblocks have any passthroughs
in the X\-dimension.
\fBUse this mode with extreme caution.\fR
.TP
\fBDYNAMIC\fR:
Create and use bgblocks as needed for each job.
Bgblocks will not be defined in the bluegene.conf file.
Dynamic partitioning may introduce fragmentation of resources
and starvation of larger jobs.
\fBUse this mode with caution.\fR
.RE

.TP
\fBMloaderImage\fR
MloaderImage used for creation of all bgblocks.
There is no default value and this must be specified.

.TP
\fBNodeCardNodeCount\fR
Number of c\-nodes per node card.
There is no default value and this must be specified. For BlueGene/L systems
this is usually 32.

.TP
\fBNumPsets\fR
The Numpsets used for creation of all bgblocks.  This value really means the
number of IO nodes on a base partition.  This number must be the smallest
number if you have a heterogeneous system.
There is no default value and this must be specified.  The typical settings
for BlueGene/L systems are as follows: For IO rich systems, 64 is the value that
should be used to create small blocks.  For systems that are not IO rich, or
for which small blocks are not desirable, 8 is usually the number to use.
For BlueGene/P IO rich systems, 32 is the value that should be used to create
small blocks since there are only 2 IO nodes per nodecard instead of 4 as on
BlueGene/L.

.LP
Each bgblock is defined by the base partitions used to construct it.
Ordering is very important for laying out switch wires.  Please use the smap
tool to define blocks and do not change the order of blocks created.
A bgblock is implicitly created containing all resources on the system.
Bgblocks must not overlap in static mode (except for implicitly
created bgblock). This will be the case when smap is used to create
a configuration file
All Nodes defined here must also be defined in the slurm.conf file.
Define only the numeric coordinates of the bgblocks here. The prefix
will be based upon the NodeName defined in slurm.conf

.TP
\fBBPs\fR
Define the coordinates of the bgblock end points.
For BlueGene/L and BlueGene/P systems there will be three coordinates (X, Y, and Z).
For BlueGene/Q systems there will be for coordinates (A, X, Y, and Z).

.TP
\fBType\fR
Define the network connection type for the bgblock.
The default value is TORUS.
.RS
.TP 8
\fBMESH\fR:
Communication occur over a mesh.
.TP
\fBSMALL\fR:
The base partition is divided into more than one bgblock.
The administrator should define the number of single node cards and
quarter base partition blocks using the options \fB32CNBlocks\fR and
\fB128CNBlocks\fR respectively for a BlueGene/L system.  \fB16CNBlocks\fR,
\fB64CNBlocks\fR, and \fB256CNBlocks\fR are also available for
BlueGene/P systems.  Keep in mind you
must have enough IO nodes to make all these configurations possible.

The total number of c\-nodes in defined blocks must not exceed
\fBBasePartitionNodeCnt\fR.
If not specified, the base partition will be divided into four
blocks.
See example below.
.TP
\fBTORUS\fR:
Communications occur over a torus (end\-points of network directly connect.
